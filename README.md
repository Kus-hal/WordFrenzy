# WordFrenzy
A complete Java GUI application for word unscramble game.

## Description
The whole code is written with the help of the Intellij Idea IDE and MySQL connector for Java Database Connectivity(JDBC). Efficient alogrithms are used to calculate the words by generating all of its permutation and searching them in an inbuilt Dictionary(Editable Dictionary).

### FrontEnd
The front end part of the application is made using the Java Swing libraries. The Intellij Idea made it easy by providing the GUI Forms.

### BackEnd
The Back end of the applicaiton takes the input string uses highly efficient algorithm to generate the permutation and search them into the dictionary. It uses the JDBC concept to search even faster and allows adding of the words into dictionary.

The searching could be more efficient if we would seperate code for the words of length greater than 10 or 12. There could be several other ways to implement that. We would come up with more efficient way in the next release.
